File notes
----------
-StraussUnits.cpp contains my current SDE code.
-regular_b_field contains a mathematica implementation of Paulo Liparri's study.
-mathematica contains mathematica scripts for computing useful things (eg, Larmor radius of electron).


Data file format
----------------
In output of Helios, NewSolarProp and SDE.f90, columns are r (AU), th (rad), ph (rad), ek (GeV), s (s).  The
first line specifies the point of origin of the trajectory (in backwards time).  Helios also writes the name
of the configuration file used to produce the run in the second line of comments.


PBS jobs
--------
Need to run the pbs job submission script in the directory pbs/, which needs to contain the script, the
SDE code's binary and a link to rundata/.  The pbs submission script is run using
    > qsub solarproparray.pbs
Status can be checked using
    > qstat
or
    > showq -u acoogan


formatting_scripts/concatenator.py
----------------------------------
Run by passing directory containing runs as the only command line argument.  Will take files with names of
the form BASENAME_run*.csv and combine them to produce the file BASENAME.csv in this directory.


Strauss_code/scripts/runformatter.sh
------------------------------------
Run in a directory containing files generated by Strauss' SDE program to fix fortran's formatting.  After
running this script, the resulting files can be combined using concatenator.py.
