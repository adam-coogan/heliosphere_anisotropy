Workflow notes
--------------

In output of NewSolarProp and SDE.f90, columns are r (AU), th (rad), ph (rad), ek (GeV), s (s).  The first
line specifies the point of origin of the trajectory (in backwards time).

Need to use Strauss_code/scripts/runformatter.sh to properly format files generated with SDE.f90 before
concatenating them.

Run files generated by different threads are to be combined using NewSolarProp/scripts/concatenator.py.
