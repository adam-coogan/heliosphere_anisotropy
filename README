File notes
----------

StraussUnits.cpp contains my current SDE code.


Data file format
----------------

In output of NewSolarProp and SDE.f90, columns are r (AU), th (rad), ph (rad), ek (GeV), s (s).  The first
line specifies the point of origin of the trajectory (in backwards time).


Fixing and combining output
---------------------------

Need to use Strauss_code/scripts/runformatter.sh to properly format files generated with SDE.f90 before
concatenating them.

Run files generated by different threads are to be combined using NewSolarProp/scripts/concatenator.py.


PBS jobs
--------

Need to run the pbs job submission script in the directory pbs/, which needs to contain the script, the
SDE code's binary and a link to rundata/.  The pbs submission script is run using

    qsub solarproparray.pbs

Status can be checked using

    qstat

or

    showq -u acoogan
